                            <p style="text-align: justify">Like physical money, cryptocurrencies are fungible, meaning
                                that
                                they can be traded or exchanged, one for another. For example, one bitcoin is always
                                equal
                                in value to another bitcoin. Similarly, a single unit of ether is always equal to

                                unit. This fungibility characteristic makes cryptocurrencies suitable as a secure medium

                            NFTs shift the crypto paradigm by making each token unique and irreplaceable, thereby making
                            it impossible for one non-fungible token to be equal to another. They are digital
                            representations of assets and have been likened to digital passports because each token
                            contains a unique, non-transferable identity to distinguish it from other tokens. They are
                            also extensible, meaning you can combine one NFT with another to “breed” a third, unique
                            NFT.

                                    Just like Bitcoin, NFTs also contain ownership details for easy identification and
                                    transfer between token holders. Owners can also add metadata or attributes

                                Perhaps the most famous use case for NFTs is that of cryptokitties. Launched in November
                                2017, cryptokitties are digital representations of cats with unique identifications on
                                Ethereum’s blockchain. Each kitty is unique and has a price in ether. They reproduce
                                among
                                themselves and produce new offspring, which have different attributes and valuations

                                racked
                                up a fan base that spent $20 million worth of ether to purchase, feed, and nurture them.
                                Some enthusiasts even spent upward of $100,000 on the effort.

                                high
                                prices, celebrity following, and high-profile thefts of some of its 10,000 NFTs.

                                used in private equity transactions as well as real estate deals.

                                provide escrow for different types of NFTs—from artwork to real estate—into a single

                            <h3>Why NFTs Are Important</h3> <br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Non-fungible tokens are an evolution of the relatively simple concept of
                                cryptocurrencies.
                                Modern finance systems consist of sophisticated trading and loan systems for different
                                asset
                                types, ranging from real estate to lending contracts to artwork. By enabling digital
                                representations of physical assets, NFTs are a step forward in the reinvention of this
                                infrastructure.</p>
                            <br>
                        </div>
                        <div class="fadehidden">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">To be sure, the idea of digital representations of physical
                                assets is not novel nor is the use of unique identification. However, when these
                                concepts
                                are combined with the benefits of a tamper-resistant blockchain of smart contracts, they
                                become a potent force for change.
                            </p>

                                Perhaps, the most obvious benefit of NFTs is market efficiency. The conversion of a
                                physical
                                asset into a digital one streamlines processes and removes intermediaries. NFTs
                                representing
                                digital or physical artwork on a blockchain remove the need for agents and allow artists
                                to
                                connect directly with their audiences. They can also improve business processes. For
                                example, an NFT for a wine bottle will make it easier for different actors in a supply
                                chain
                                to interact with it and help track its provenance, production, and sale through the
                                entire
                                process. Consulting firm Ernst & Young has already developed such a solution for one of
                                its
                                clients.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Non-fungible tokens are also excellent for identity
                                management.
                                Consider the case of physical passports that need to be produced at every entry and exit
                                point. By converting individual passports into NFTs, each with its own unique
                                identifying
                                characteristics, it is possible to streamline the entry and exit processes for
                                jurisdictions. Expanding this use case, NFTs can serve an identity management purpose
                                within
                                the digital realm as well.</p> <br>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">NFTs can also democratize investing by fractionalizing
                                physical
                                assets like real estate. It is much easier to divide a digital real estate asset among
                                multiple owners than a physical one. That tokenization ethic need not be constrained to
                                real
                                estate; it can extend to other assets, such as artwork. Thus, a painting need not always
                                have a single owner. Its digital equivalent can have multiple owners, each responsible
                                for a
                                fraction of the painting. Such arrangements could increase its worth and revenues.</p>

                                new markets and forms of investment. Consider a piece of real estate parceled out into
                                multiple divisions, each of which contains different characteristics and property types.
                                One
                                of the divisions might be next to a beach while another is in an entertainment complex,
                                and
                                yet another is a residential district. Depending on its characteristics, each piece of
                                land
                                is unique, priced differently, and represented with an NFT. Real estate trading, a

                                and bureaucratic affair, can be simplified by incorporating relevant metadata into each

                                including
                                online-only assets like digital artwork and real assets such as real estate. Other

                            <p style="text-align: justify">Many NFTs can only be purchased with Ether, so owning some of
                                this cryptocurrency—and storing it in a digital wallet—is usually the first step. You
                                can
                                then purchase NFTs via any of the online NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea, Rarible,
                                and
                                SuperRare.</p>

                                like
                                cryptocurrency, are generally secure. The distributed nature of blockchains makes NFTs
                                difficult (although not impossible) to hack. One security risk for NFTs is that you
                                could
                                lose access to your non-fungible token if the platform hosting the NFT goes out of
                                business.

                            <h3>What Does Non-Fungible Mean?</h3><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">Fungibility is an economics term that describes the
                                interchangeability of certain goods. For example, a barrel of oil is fungible
                                (interchangeable/indistinguishable) from any other barrel of oil. A dollar bill,
                                likewise,
                                is equal to any other dollar bill (or 4 quarters, etc.). Non-fungible is to render such
                                items unique or distinguishable. For instance, if you were to take a dollar bill and
                                have it
                                drawn on and signed by a famous artist, it become unique - unlike all other dollar
                                bills,
                                and perhaps worth more than its face value.
