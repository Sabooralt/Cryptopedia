                        <h2>What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2><br><br>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is
                            secured by cryptography, which makes it
                            nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized
                            networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network
                            of
                            computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by
                            any
                            central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or
                            manipulation.</p>

                            distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them
                            to
                            exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.

                            technology. As its name indicates, blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks
                            or an
                            online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently
                            verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be verified by
                            each
                            node before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories.

                            The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an
                            individual
                            node, or computer maintaining a copy of the ledger.

                            Nakamoto invented it and introduced it to the world via a white paper in 2008. There are

                            In the wake of Bitcoin's success, many other cryptocurrencies, known as "altcoins," have

                            been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial

                                Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system,

                                in value over the past decade, at one point reaching almost $2 trillion. As of May
                                2022,
                                Bitcoin was valued at more than $550 billion in crypto markets.</li>

                            <li>The remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases.
                                Currently, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to
                                streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to
                                Bitcoin
                                (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders and, subsequently, converted
                                to
                                the destination fiat currency. This method streamlines the money transfer process
                                and
                                makes it cheaper.</li>

                            <li>In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed

                                For
                                example, an MIT study found that just 11,000 investors held roughly 45% of Bitcoin's

                                with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires
                                considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The
                                expensive

                                exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have
                                been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in millions of dollars worth of
                                "coins"
